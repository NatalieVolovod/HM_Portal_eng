                    <i>If a hand-mader is wound up in your house, you will immediately notice it, because you will have a big question: how to live on. For the appearance in the house of a hand-made man fundamentally undermines the usual mode of life. </i>
                    <h2>I hope our tips will help you.</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3>Habitat.</h3>
                        There are a lot of places for hand-maders. A large room with a bunch of shelves, boxes and two or three tables is best suited. Remember, no matter how many shelves you make your new pet will take them all! And certainly require more. Boxes will also be busy and forgotten with various garbage. Never tidy up in the house of a hand-mader, because what is rubbish for you, valuable objects for them!
                        Your pet’s bed should be comfortable, and there must be a cabinet with a lamp nearby, suddenly an attack of activity will attack him in the middle of the night.
                        Also, the room must have: a computer with Internet access (otherwise a hand-mader will take yours), a lot of paper, albums, notebooks, pens, pencils and other writing instruments as well as various tools. Here, a hand-maders preferences can vary greatly, so it’s better to buy tools not in advance, but with your pet. But never send it to the store alone! Otherwise, a hand-mader will bring home a bunch of everything except what you sent it for.</li>
                        <li><h3>Feeding.</h3>
                        Your pet's diet should be varied. But at the same time, so that food can be eaten quickly and go into the room, but it is better to take food with you. Keep in mind that a hand-mader will not cook food for you or yourself. Is that sculpt vegetables and fruits from plastic, but they are not edible.</li>
                        <li><h3>Features of life.</h3>
                        A hand-mader spends most of his time in his room and does something there. If your pet is very passionate about the process, it is better not to interfere, and not to enter its territory at all. If you do not let your pet create during the day, he will go into the night mode of life (be careful if your hand-mader stops getting enough sleep, he may become angry or become depressed). From time to time, you need to walk the hand-mader so that your pet breathes fresh air. It’s not easy to get him out of the house, the best ways to persuade him to go for a walk: go shopping with him (don’t take a lot of money with you, because everyone will spend it), offer him photographs of his products in nature, send him to participate in the fair. In other ways, you are unlikely to lure him into the fresh air. Sometimes your pet may not behave quite adequately (for example, bake beads in the oven, bring shapeless clothes from the flea market and cut them into rags, collect buttons, use things as you like, but not for their intended purpose, etc.)</li>
